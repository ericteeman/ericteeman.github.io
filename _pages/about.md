## About Me

I am a recent graduate from the Materials Science & Engineering Department at the University of Washington, Seattle and former member of the Krishnan Group. I also worked in collaboration with Dr. James Evans of Pacific Northwest National Lab. My research focused on nanoparticle synthesis, surface conjugation, cell interactions, and fate in vitro. The goal of my research was the safer preparation and use of nanomaterials in biomedical applications as more and more interesting techniques and treatments are developed.
